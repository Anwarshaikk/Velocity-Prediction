# üìù Drive Cycle Velocity Prediction Project

## üåü Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for **vehicle velocity patterns** using both **standard and synthetic drive cycle datasets**. By employing **time-series analysis** and **machine learning**, specifically **LSTM networks**, we predict the speed variations of a vehicle based on past driving data. The project has potential applications in **automotive testing**, **fuel efficiency analysis**, and **emissions studies**.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Drive_Cycle_Velocity_Prediction.git
   cd Drive_Cycle_Velocity_Prediction
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üîÆ Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Run the scripts in the **Scripts/Data_Preprocessing/** directory to prepare the datasets for training.

2. **Synthetic Data Generation**:
   - Use scripts in **Scripts/Synthetic_Generation/** to generate synthetic datasets with controlled noise.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Use the notebooks or scripts in **Notebooks/Model_Training/** and **Scripts/Model_Training/** to train the LSTM model on the datasets.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using the notebooks in **Notebooks/Evaluation/**. The evaluation will generate histograms and graphs comparing actual and predicted velocities.

5. **MATLAB Simulations**:
   - The **Matlab_Simulations/** folder contains files that can be used to run simulations and modify vehicle controllers using the velocity predictions from the model.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Data Augmentation**: Synthetic datasets were generated to introduce variability in driving conditions, which improved the model's robustness.
- **Model**: The **LSTM** model architecture effectively captured the temporal dependencies of vehicle velocity data.
- **Evaluation**: Histograms and time-series plots were used to validate the performance of the velocity prediction model.
- **MATLAB Integration**: MATLAB simulations were performed to explore the applicability of the predicted velocity profiles in optimizing electric vehicle controllers.

## üìå Results

- The model was evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to measure prediction accuracy.
- Time-series graphs and histograms comparing actual and predicted velocities demonstrated that the model successfully learned the overall distribution and patterns of the driving data.

## üîÆ Future Work

- **Controller Integration**: Integrate the velocity prediction model with electric vehicle controllers in MATLAB.
- **Model Predictive Control**: Implement **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** for real-time velocity prediction to enhance driving performance.
- **Additional Datasets**: Expand the dataset to include more varied drive cycles, improving model generalizability.
